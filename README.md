This one was fun to work on as it seemed really simple at first glance but I quickly realized it was much trickier due to the different alignments that needed to be worked through.

### BONUS: Try to see if you can get the header to be fixed to the top of the screen.
I briefly attempted to fix the header to the top of the screen with position:fixed, but I think it broke the alignment of everything in the header.  Wanted to move on to second example so did not spend too much time attempting.

I found this one to be the most difficult.  I spent a long time trying to figure out how to center the text and logo on top of the ATL image and also trying to get the top navigation in the correct spot.  I noticed that when floating these lists it changes the order of the items.  I fixed it by changing the order in the HTML so they are in the correct order after being floated.  Not sure if this is best practice or not.

### BONUS: Instead of using the three icon images in the /img folder, try to implement the icons using pure HTML and CSS (hint: use border-radius and absolute positioning)
I initially started out trying to use pure HTML and CSS for this, but after spending so much time on the header, I decided to use the images.  May go back and re-try this if I find the time.

Still working on this one, but I thought it was easier than the second one.  Might be from having more practice and being more comfortable with CSS at this point.  Trying out the blockquote tag.
